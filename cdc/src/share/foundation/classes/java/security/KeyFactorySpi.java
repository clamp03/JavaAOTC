/**
 * This class defines the <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>)
 * for the <code>KeyFactory</code> class.
 * All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each 
 * cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 * of a key factory for a particular algorithm.
 *
 * <P> Key factories are used to convert <I>keys</I> (opaque
 * cryptographic keys of type <code>Key</code>) into <I>key specifications</I>
 * (transparent representations of the underlying key material), and vice
 * versa.
 *
 * <P> Key factories are bi-directional. That is, they allow you to build an
 * opaque key object from a given key specification (key material), or to
 * retrieve the underlying key material of a key object in a suitable format.
 *
 * <P> Multiple compatible key specifications may exist for the same key.
 * For example, a DSA public key may be specified using
 * <code>DSAPublicKeySpec</code> or
 * <code>X509EncodedKeySpec</code>. A key factory can be used to translate
 * between compatible key specifications.
 *
 * <P> A provider should document all the key specifications supported by its
 * key factory.
